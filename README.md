Face Recognition using Siamese Neural Network :
---------------------------------------------

This project contains two main files,
```
1 - Face Recognition (RGB) - Runs the model on color images
2 - Face Recognition (GreyScale) - Runs the model on Grey-scale images.
```
The datafile, images.csv has two features namely  Image(base64 encoded image) and Name(Name of the person).

To directly download scaled_subset_grey.npy use https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Qp8_JxZamhY7EstHkuycODV77lVLmqH/view
        
The jupyter notebook FaceRecognitionGrey.ipynb has the final model we trained. The notebook is well documented and has useful comments and headings to increase the readability.
